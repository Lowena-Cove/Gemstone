# Gemstone: access your favourite streaming services and Non-Steam games seamlessly inside the SteamOS menu.

Gemstone is an open-source plugin for SteamOS that seamlessly integrates cloud gaming and movie/TV streaming services into the SteamOS frontend, providing a unified and enhanced user experience. I was going to add support for more game libraries, but after talking to the creator of Junk-Store, this will become a companion plugin that comes with/requires and also modifies the Junk-Store plugin, expanding it for the wider scope of Gemstone in a way that doesnt disregard all the hard work being put into his project.

## Features

- **Cloud Gaming Integration**: Access popular cloud gaming services directly from the SteamOS interface.
- **Streaming Services**: Seamlessly navigate and stream content from various movie and TV streaming platforms, including a TV Guide.
- **More than just Steam**: Enjoy all your Games from other Platforms, with our Junk-Store-like functionality.
- **Mods Galore**: No workshop for your game? well enjoy having custom-local workshops pulling from Mod platforms such as Curseforge, ModDB and Gamebanana.
- **Unified Frontend**: Enjoy all your gaming and streaming services in one place without having to switch between different applications.
- **Easy Installation**: Installable via Decky Loader for a hassle-free setup.
